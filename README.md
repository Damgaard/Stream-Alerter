Stream Alerter
===========

Small program that notifies when either a great Starcraft 2 Streamer goes 
online or an unknown streamer hits a popularity mark. 

Looks at streams at Justin.TV and Own3d.tv. Only looks at SC2 streams atm, but changing it to watch other streams is trivial

THIS PROGRAM CANNOT POST TO TWITTER without the authentications. They should be
stored in a separate file called twitterAuth.p.

Notes:
This program is tested and confirmed to work on linux with yad installed.
It may or may not work on other OS. No guarentees.
