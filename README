Small program to detect whether certain (great) SC2 streamers have gone online
or whether an unknown stream has hit a specific view count milestone. The latter
makes it easy to detect events or other reasons an irrelevant stream suddenly
becomes relevant.

Looks at streams at JustinTv, specifically its gaming subset twitchTv, and Own3d.tv

Only looks at SC2 streams atm, but changing it to watch other streams is trivial

THIS PROGRAM CANNOT POST TO TWITTER without the authentications. They should be
stored in a separate file called twitterAuth.py, which is imported. OAuths for
twitter (to tweet) and google id (for the URL shortener) are needed.

Notes:
Only tested on a Linux machine. Pop ups will certainly not work on windows.
The rest should, but again. Untested
